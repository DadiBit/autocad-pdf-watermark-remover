You firstly need to uncompress the printed pdf to be able to edit them with a tool like pdftoolkit.
The .bat script will use pdftoolkit to uncompress and re-compress the pdfs.
To manually remove the watermarks from the uncompress pdf run `rmwm.exe original-uncompressed.pdf nowatermark-uncompressed.pdf`.
